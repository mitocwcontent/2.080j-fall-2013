Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _2.080J Structural Mechanics_ as it was taught by Prof. Tomasz Wierzbicki in Fall 2013.

This course teaches students fundamental concepts of structural mechanics with applications to marine, civil, and mechanical structures.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Use the one-dimensional and two-dimensional structural idealizations of beams, columns, columns, rods, and shell beams to determine stress and deformation states
*   Apply such structural idealizations to model general structural configurations under specified loading in order to determine the stress and deformation states
*   Assess the applicability of such structural idealizations and judge the errors introduced in their use

Curriculum Information
----------------------

### Prerequisites

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

Lecture
-------

*   Met twice per week for 1.5 hours per session; 24 sessions total
*   Prof. Wierzbicki introduced new material to the class

Recitation
----------

*   Met once per week for one hour per session; 12 sessions total
*   Teaching assistants reviewed lecture material

Out of Class
------------

*   Work on the [problem sets]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments)
*   Study for the [quizzes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/quizzes)
